  #### *Tests:*

  As an exercise in object-oriented programming, this app relies on five classes to function. The Engineer, Intern, and Manager classes each extend class Employee, while the Team class contains an array of Engineer, Intern, and/or Manager class objects in its "members" property. Detailed tests have been drafted and deployed for each of the 5 classes.
